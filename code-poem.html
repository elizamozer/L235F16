  i think a lot about <big>gravity</big> <br>
  and <big>physical<big> gravity <br>
  and maybe there's <strong>emotional</strong> gravity<br>
  where we each have a <center>pole</center> <br>
  that ideas revolve around like <sub> planets and </sub> stars <br>
  and we are the <sup>er sun </sup>er<br>
always there always lingering <br>
with light that never fizzles<br>
