  i think a lot about <big>gravity</big> <br>
  physical gravity <br>
  and maybe there's emotional gravity <br>
  where we each have a <center>pole</center> <br>
that ideas revolve around like planets and stars <br>
and we are the sun <br>
always there always lingering <br>
with light that never fizzles<br>
